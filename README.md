# HW1-Master
HW1-Master Template

This repository contains a Racket source file named `sort.rkt` that contains a complete solution (in the form required for Comp 311) for the problem of sorting a list of numbers into ascending order.  This file is a good starting point for writing solutions to the problems in HW1 [https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/FPSCALA/HW1] which must be formulated as single file named `HW1.rkt`.  You can use the "Save As" command in DrRacket to rename your edited file to `HW1.rkt`.  You may also choose to delete the sample problem solution in sort.rkt once you have finished writing your solutions.

Your solutions packaged as the file HW1.rkt are due by 11:59pm on Thursday, Sep 8.  As usual in Github Classroom, the final state of your program at midnight Sep 9 is your submitted solution.  You do not have to separately submit anything.

Enjoy!
